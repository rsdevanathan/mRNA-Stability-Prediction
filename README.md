# mRNA-Stability-Prediction

Our Graduate course project for computational data analysis. The objective of the project is to improve the Stability of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine by predicting the reactivity and degradation of RNA sequences under various environmental parameters like temperature and PH levels. The project is chosen based on the recently concluded Kaggle competition, https://www.kaggle.com/c/Stanford-covid-vaccine/overview.
